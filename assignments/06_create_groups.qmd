## `r fontawesome::fa("bullseye")` Objectives

- Create sections and populate them with questions
- Create sub-sections and move questions into them

## 1. Create a housing section

- Create a new section to contain the housing module you developed [last week](/assignments/05_create_basic_questionnaire.qmd).
- Give it an appropriate title
- Add an appropriate emoji (e.g., `r emoji::emoji("house_with_garden")`). If useful, search for emojis [here](https://emojipedia.org/).

## 2. Move housing content into it

Move each question from its current question to the newly created section.

This may seem inefficient because one could always rename the current section, but this is for practice.

## 3. Create thematic sub-sections

Create the following sub-sections:

- Construction materials: questions 3-5
- Access to electricity: questions 8-13
- Sources of energy: 14-15
- Sources of water and sanitation: 16-35

Move questions into them.
